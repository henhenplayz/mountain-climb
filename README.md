This project implements a program that simulates a mountain hiking expedition using a binary search tree. The hiker starts at the peak of the mountain and must find their way down safely while managing limited resources and overcoming obstacles.

The mountain is modeled as a binary search tree, where each node represents a rest-stop. At each rest-stop, the hiker can replenish supplies, but they may also face obstacles that require specific resources to overcome. The paths from the root to the leaves represent different trails, and once the hiker starts on a path, there is no turning back. Some paths may lead to dangerous cliffs, while others will lead the hiker safely to the base of the mountain.

The program generates a list of all possible survival paths that the hiker can take, ensuring they have the resources needed to reach the bottom.
